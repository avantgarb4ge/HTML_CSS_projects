			<h2>Blockquote</h2>
				<p>Here is a quote from CNPS' website:</p>
				<blockquote cite="https://www.cnps.org/gardening/gardening-in-a-drought">
				Do you know that 50% of residential water use goes to outdoor irrigation? Often that water is wasted on thirsty green lawns, which came into fashion in England and are unsuited to our climate and resources. Water restrictions are turning green lawns brown and making it clear that we need to rediscover the natural beauty of California plants. Now is the time to replace that dead lawn with plants that evolved to thrive in our climate, and that are drought tolerant, low maintenance, and beloved by pollinators like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds.
